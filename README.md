## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nutritherapy-solutions
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory to configure your API keys.

   ```env
   # Required: Google Gemini API Key for AI features
   VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

   # Optional: OpenAI API Key (if switching provider)
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   > **Note**: The project currently uses a hardcoded configuration for Supabase in `services/supabase.ts` for testing purposes. For a production setup, you should update `services/supabase.ts` to use environment variables like `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

4. **Run Locally**
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
